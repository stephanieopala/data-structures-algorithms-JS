## Binary Search Tree

- An ordered data structure made up of nodes that are either null or have references to other nodes. These ‘other’ nodes are child nodes, known as a left node and right node.
- Nodes have values.
- Each node is referenced by only one node.
- The left subtree of a node contains nodes with lesser values/data than that of the parent.
- The right subtree of a node contains nodes with lesser values/data than that of the parent.

### Full Tree

The nodes have either 2 children or no children.

### Complete Tree

We fill from left to right.

### Perfect Tree

Combination of both complete and full tree.
All the leaves are on the same level, and all the nodes that have children have exactly 2 children.
