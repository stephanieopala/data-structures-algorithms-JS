## Arrays
Arrays in JavaScript are inbuilt and zero indexed.

### Operations on arrays
#### Adding items to an array
- push()
Adds elements to the end
- unshift()
Adds elements to the start of a n array.
The time complexity is O(n) because the indices are shifted by one and this reduces performance especially if the length of the array is long.
